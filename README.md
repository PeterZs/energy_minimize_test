This figure is the result of mesh fairing with using different Laplace based energy: left: membrane surface energy, middle: thin-plate surface,right: minimum variation surface energy.

An implementation of the paper An Intuitive Framework for Real-Time Freeform Modeling, deforming mesh using different Laplace based energy: membrane surface energy, thin-plate surface, minimum variation surface energy with some fixed point constraints.
